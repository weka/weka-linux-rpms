We want to thank you for installing Rocky Linux.

The Rocky Linux OS Distribution would not be possible without the hard work and
dedication of the community. Building a distribution is far from easy, but with
unified visions and goals, anything is possible, and Rocky is one of many
examples of this.

The outpouring support from the community and the amount of people who to
together to support us, we want to thank you for believing in us and giving us
a chance. And as always, we hope you enjoy this release.

Thank you.
